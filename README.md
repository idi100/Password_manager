# Password_manager

This project in short is a password folder. Think of it like Google's password manager, where passwords can be stored.

Problem: Retrieving passwords stored in Google's password manager, Mac's password manager, and all the other places I keep passwords is hectic. 

Solution: I have recreated a password manager in Python, showcasing different file operations for efficient retrieval.

Steps:
1. Create an entry password/master password.
2. Add the password you want to save along with a name or account.
3. You know have the option of adding more passwords or viewing the file with the saved passwords.
